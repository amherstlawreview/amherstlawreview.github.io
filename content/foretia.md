Abstract
My paper critiques Hannah Arendt’s assessment of chattel slavery in chapter nine of The Origins
of Totalitarianism (1951). I argue that the enslavement of Africans and their descendants in
antebellum United States constitutes a form of statelessness. By comparing the experiences of
enslaved Africans to those of European refugees during the interwar period, the paper shows
how Arendt misses significant parallels in the conditions of both groups. I compare the
respective roles of enslaved Africans and stateless Europeans in systems of economic
production, and consider the ways in which these groups were made into foreigners by their
countries of residence such that they were excluded from political participation. This paper will
also examine how Arendt’s theory of statelessness parallels sociologist Orlando Patterson’s
theory of natal alienation, which describes the extreme cultural dispossession endured by
enslaved people. Finally, I will consider the different forms of legal recognition accorded to
people based on their categorization as stateless or enslaved, with a particular focus on the
Supreme Court ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).




Introduction

           The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) has endured as a founding text in anti-imperial

studies due to Hannah Arendt’s incisive critiques of European fascism and the inequalities of

citizenship produced by the nation-state system. Despite this, American exceptionalism and

Eurocentrism pervade much of Arendt’s political writings. Contemporary scholars have already

criticized the philosopher’s reverence for the U.S., as it has impeded her ability to properly

contextualize the republic’s history of white supremacy.<sup><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-link">108</a></sup> In Origins, Arendt circumscribes the

development of the Rights of Man to the French and American Revolutions, rendering the

Haitian Revolution invisible and the role of slavery in revolutionary founding unthinkable. The

issue persists in On Revolution (1963), where Arendt makes scant reference to Black chattel
<sup><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-link">108</a></sup>
      Owens, “Racism in the Theory Canon”; Gaffney, “Memories of Exclusion.”

                                                       <sup><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-link">55</a></sup>

slavery and none to the Haitian Revolution, despite the latter tethering self-government to

abolitionism and both directly impacting natural rights discourse. Arendt’s failure to properly

contextualize chattel slavery within the history of democratic citizenship undercuts her ability to

diagnose citizenship’s antithesis—statelessness. In chapter nine of Origins, Arendt characterizes

the United States as the “country par excellence of immigration” and asserts that the country has

always viewed newcomers, including stateless Europeans, as having the potential to be

citizens.<sup><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-link">109</a></sup> One would have to exclude Africans forcibly taken through the Middle Passage and

into the U.S. from the category of “newcomers” for Arendt’s assertion to be sensical.

Consequently, Arendt misses important connections between the respective conditions of the

stateless and the enslaved.

            Examining Arendt’s theory of statelessness in light of the experiences of enslaved and

manumitted Africans in the U.S. makes our understanding of statelessness more expansive. In

chapter nine of Origins, Arendt uses “rightless” and “stateless” interchangeably to describe the

condition European refugees found themselves in during the interwar period. I contend that

rightlessness is the defining feature of statelessness. Statelessness deprives people of the

supposedly inalienable rights they are entitled to as citizens, the most fundamental ones being the

right to political action and the right to opinion. Because Arendt treats rightlessness and

statelessness as synonymous, the distinction she draws between slavery and statelessness is

highly questionable. Chattel slavery, like Arendtian statelessness, removes an individual from

participating in the social contract as an autonomous agent, because their humanity was

rhetorically unacknowledged by the contract and they were treated as an object to the contract.

As a result, the master-slave relationship heightens the inequality of power Arendt observes



<sup><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-link">109</a></sup>
      Arendt, “The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man,” <sup><a href="#fn277" class="footnote-link">277</a></sup>. The quote is in footnote <sup><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-link">21</a></sup>.

                                                           <sup><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-link">56</a></sup>

between the citizen and the stateless. In the U.S., slavery created a dynamic antithetical to the

one between citizens because American citizenship is premised on equality under the law.

       This paper argues that kidnapped Africans and their descendants experienced

statelessness in Antebellum United States. I will first reconstruct Arendt’s argument about the

condition of statelessness and her comparison of it with slavery. Then, I will compare the

respective roles of enslaved people and stateless people in systems of economic production. This

comparison will show that Arendt misses how economic extraction motivates polities to create

stateless persons within their borders. Next, I will consider the ways in which enslaved Black

people and stateless Europeans were made into foreigners by their countries of residence such

that they were excluded from political participation. To this end, I will show that much of

Arendt’s analysis of statelessness is consonant with the concept of natal alienation, which

Jamaican sociologist Orlando Patterson developed to articulate the cultural dispossession

experienced by enslaved people in his book Slavery and Social Death (1982). Through Patterson,

we see how white slaveholders wielded the same authoritarian power that European nation-states

used to render people rightless and internally exiled. But for the enslaved, this authoritarianism

occurred both on societal and interpersonal levels. Next, this paper will show that Dred Scott v.

Sandford (1857) ratified the status of enslaved Africans as stateless persons and exposed free

Black people to that same status. This judicial decision unambiguously placed all Black people

outside of the political community with no recourse. Finally, I will consider the different forms

of legal recognition accorded to people based on their categorization as stateless or enslaved.



Understanding the Right to Have Rights




                                                 <sup><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-link">57</a></sup>

         According to Origins, rightlessness is the condition that stateless people find themselves

in. This condition entails the loss of legal status, the right to action, and the right to free speech.

Not only are stateless people rejected from the polity of the country in which they reside, but

they have a minuscule chance of becoming a full-fledged member of another polity due to their

status as perpetual foreigners. For Arendt, statelessness is problematic because it is global. If

stateless people enter another territory, they will at best be regarded as charity rather than people

to whom that territory has an obligation to protect. The absence of obligation means that stateless

people have no recourse if nations revoke their protection: “[N]o law exists which could force

the nations to feed them.”<sup><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-link">110</a></sup> The transience in which stateless people live serves as a

precondition for genocide, as evidenced by the persecution of Jewish and Armenian people in

interwar Europe. When Arendt says that enslaved people “still belonged to some sort of human

community” due to the necessity of their labor, she is reflecting on the extermination camps

Jewish people were sent to during the Holocaust specifically because the Nazi regime saw no

place or need for Jewish people in the German polity.<sup><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-link">111</a></sup> Through the Nuremberg laws, Nazi

Germany isolated Jewish people from the rest of the world and rendered them rightless.<sup><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-link">112</a></sup> In

sum, the stateless individual is no longer viewed as a person before the law, and they cannot turn

to the political community for remedy.

         Arendt uses slavery as a foil to underscore the severe unbelonging that stateless

Europeans experienced. We must first assess the scope of Arendt’s comparison: Is Arendt

referring to slavery in antiquity? Is she including other forms of forced servitude, such as debt

bondage or prison labor? Since Arendt says little on this matter, we might instead turn to

Aristotle, whom Arendt cites while comparing statelessness to slavery. In Politics, Aristotle

<sup><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-link">110</a></sup>
    Ibid., <sup><a href="#fn296" class="footnote-link">296</a></sup>. Italics has been added for emphasis.

    Ibid., <sup><a href="#fn288" class="footnote-link">288</a></sup>-<sup><a href="#fn289" class="footnote-link">289</a></sup>.

                                                       <sup><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-link">58</a></sup>

developed his theory of natural slavery, arguing that some humans are born servile and others

rulers, to justify chattel slavery in Athenian democracy.<sup><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-link">113</a></sup> We can reasonably conclude that

Arendt is orienting her discussion around this particular type of unfree labor, as opposed to

serfdom practices in other Greek city-states. Furthermore, Arendt asserts that slavery’s

“fundamental offense” was creating conditions wherein some people were born enslaved and

others free, which excludes some people “from the even possibility of fighting for freedom.”<sup><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-link">114</a></sup>

This applies to natural slavery and partus sequitur ventrem—a doctrine in Roman slave law

dictating that a child inherits their mother’s status with regard to enslavement. This doctrine

would later be used in the Americas. Given that Arendt wrote Origins while residing in the U.S.

and she envisions the U.S. as having a key role in post-totalitarian politics,<sup><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-link">115</a></sup> the experiences of

enslaved Africans in the U.S. are relevant for assessing the validity of her distinction between

slavery and statelessness.

        One may reasonably worry that any comparison between statelessness and American

slavery is inappropriate due to the very real differences in international relations that emerged in

between the height of the Transatlantic slave trade and the time of Arendt’s writings.

Constitutionalism had only emerged in the Age of Revolution, and did not dominate national

governments as it would after World War II. In contrast, Arendt’s conception of statelessness is

informed by the modern international system of states, with specific reference to the League of

Nations and the United Nations. The temporality of Arendt’s argument can be most felt here:

“The second loss which the rightless suffered was the loss of government protection, and this did

not imply just the loss of legal status in their own, but in all countries.”<sup><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-link">116</a></sup> In this respect, the

    Arendt, <sup><a href="#fn297" class="footnote-link">297</a></sup>. Arendt further elaborates on the role of slavery in Greek and Roman societies in On Human
Condition (1958) and On Revolution (1963).

intergovernmental treatment of chattel slavery during the long <sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-link">19</a></sup>th century is not quite

analogous, as there were no centralized bodies for diplomacy to regulate such treatment.

        Despite this, antislavery contributed significantly to the founding of international human

rights law. We see this shift in international relations with Great Britain, which signed bilateral

treaties with other empires in the Americas to end all participation in the Transatlantic slave

trade after they imposed their own ban in 1807.<sup><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-link">117</a></sup> But chattel slavery—and thus the possibility

for Afro-descended people to be rendered rightless—was still alive in the Americas until the end

of the <sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-link">19</a></sup>th century. Moreover, understanding American chattel slavery as it relates to Arendtian

statelessness is important because the Rights of Man did not spring into being in the <sup><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-link">20</a></sup>th

century. This egalitarian discourse on rights was directly built off of centuries of Black slave

labor and set the stage for modern capitalist exploitation. The founding of the American republic

created self-government without emancipation. Referencing the American and French

Revolutions, Arendt recognizes the philosophical paradoxes of the Rights of Man to an extent.

The universalism associated with the inalienable rights of the individual runs counter to cultural

particularism of the nation-state, and ignores how such cultural particularism determines who has

the right to have rights.<sup><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-link">118</a></sup> However, rightlessness encompasses far more than the refugee

problem in interwar Europe. To conceive enslaved Africans and their descendants as rightless is

to capture the full scale of philosophical paradoxes that underlie American citizenship.



Economic Extraction and the Rightless

        Arendt argues that enslaved people, unlike the stateless, had a recognized place in society

through their exploited labor. Thus, enslaved people still had “a distinctive character, a place in

Origins of International Human Rights Law.

    Arendt, “The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man,” <sup><a href="#fn291" class="footnote-link">291</a></sup>.

                                                        <sup><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-link">60</a></sup>

society—more than the abstract nakedness of being human and nothing but human.”<sup><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-link">119</a></sup> In other

words, Arendt separates enslaved people from stateless people partly because stateless people

were treated by European nation-states as disposable in a way that, according to her, enslaved

people were not treated as by their host communities. This argument holds currency today: civil

rights activist Michelle Alexander echoes Arendt’s sentiment—that enslaved people had a

recognized place within society—when she categorizes slavery as a system of exploitation and

mass incarceration as a system of marginalization in The New Jim Crow (2010). The former

system at least acknowledges that the individual being exploited—the enslaved Black person—is

needed in the economy.<sup><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-link">120</a></sup> In this line of argument, however, both authors fail to consider how, by

being recognized as property, each enslaved person was seen as replaceable.

         This replaceability is antithetical to the ideological premises of most Western

nation-states, where contractarian logic dominates and the dignity of the individual is viewed as

foundational to one’s citizenship. This hypocrisy led Frederick Douglass to declare slavery

unconstitutional, as America’s founding documents entitled men to “a natural right of

freedom.”<sup><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-link">121</a></sup> Given the centrality of property rights in the founding of the American republic,

enslaved Black bodies were made into objects of the social contract, such that their existence was

bound by the will of white people, who were free-born and could act as subjects of the contract,

i.e. consenting parties.<sup><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-link">122</a></sup> The inclusion of the Three-Fifths Compromise and Fugitive Slave

Clause in the U.S. Constitution prove this effect. Beyond the Constitution, white supremacy

reified enslaved people’s status as objects through sales contracts between slave traders and

buyers, agreements to temporarily lease out the enslaved person to another person, inheritance

transfers, and documents related to estate management. The enslaved person’s role as

object-worker—or an “animate instrument” as Aristotle describes—meant that they were still

outside of the polity, which exposes them to immeasurable violence often endorsed by the law.<sup><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-link">123</a></sup>

         If we are to consider chattel slavery vis-à-vis Arendtian statelessness, then we must ask:

How does slavery fit into Arendt’s understanding of labor in relation to citizenship? Some

scholars characterize Arendt as devaluing labor and work relative to political action in her

polemic The Human Condition (1958). However, Prof. Ayten Gündoğdu disagrees with this

reading, arguing that Arendt understands labor to be indispensable to the human experience.<sup><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-link">124</a></sup>

Arendt characterizes the right to work as an “elementary right” on par with the right to residence

in Origins.<sup><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-link">125</a></sup> But this conception of labor as a means of asserting one’s dignity assumes that the

laborer chooses how and for whom they work, as well as an ability to earn wages from that work.

Arendt’s brief discussion of migrants in European labor markets proves that being economically

useful does not yield legal or social protection for the rightless. For example, France exploited

stateless people in the 1930s by “calling in alien workers in times of need and deporting them in

times of unemployment and crisis.”<sup><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-link">126</a></sup> More damningly, refugees were often subjected to forced

labor in concentration camps by both Nazi Germany and many European states post-World War

II. Although to a different degree than enslaved Africans, stateless Europeans were often reduced

to a laboring entity by the society in which they resided. Political theorist Michael Walzer says

that statelessness does not preclude one’s participation in distributive relations, but without

protection from any state, non-members are especially vulnerable in the marketplace.<sup><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-link">127</a></sup>

           Enslavement is arguably the greatest danger posed to non-members in the marketplace, as

they become the commodity themselves. For enslaved people, work is no longer the services one

chooses to offer for a fixed price and time, but something to be extracted indefinitely by the

person who benefits from those services. While free labor can uplift the human spirit, the

absence of compensation in forced labor degrades the enslaved person’s spirit. By not receiving

rightful compensation, the enslaved person must dedicate their existence to maintaining

subsistence. Such deprivation automatically precludes the enslaved from taking civic action that

would be considered customary within the polity, such as attending a protest, signing a petition,

or going to a town hall meeting. Rather than grant the right to political action, governments

rendered enslaved people politically inert. The only viable way for enslaved people to contest

their status as a commodity is illegally—either by running away or starting an uprising. History

has borne this out, as white anxieties rose with the growth of the Underground Railroad and

revolts such as Nat Turner’s Rebellion. Without illegal contestation, the economic deprivation of

chattel slavery works to immobilize the enslaved person both physically and socially. White

Americans justified the immobility of enslaved Africans on account of their foreignness.



The Mark of the Foreigner

           Cultural dispossession plays a key role in nation-states rendering ethnic minorities

rightless, as evidenced by Arendt’s discussion of assimilation. Differences in language, culture,

and religion distinguished refugees from nationals in the interwar period. European nation-states

sought to eradicate this difference because, as Arendt puts it, “in every sense the refugees

represented separate foreign minorities who frequently did not care to be naturalized.”<sup><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-link">128</a></sup> From

the perspective of European nation-states, they were not obligated to provide protection to
<sup><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-link">128</a></sup>
      Arendt, “The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man,” <sup><a href="#fn282" class="footnote-link">282</a></sup>.

                                                          <sup><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-link">63</a></sup>

refugees if they did not adopt the nation’s customs. When nation-states realized they could not

forcibly “transform [refugees] into nationals of the country of refuge,” they pursued deportation

and internment.<sup><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-link">129</a></sup> The imperative to divorce rightless people from their cultural heritage was not

exclusive to European refugees, as this same imperative emerged in American chattel slavery. An

African enslaved in the U.S. belonged to their host community as a possession, and was actively

denied a political family to share heritage with. According to Patterson, the eradication of

kinship ties and cultural heritage severed the enslaved person from the society they were stolen

from and the society by which they were enslaved.<sup><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-link">130</a></sup> This severance morphed the enslaved

person into a non-human Other. Patterson terms this radical condition of foreignness “natal

alienation.”

         In the United States, Blackness became the mark of foreignness, which white

slaveholders used to justify the Transatlantic slave trade. As a result, communal ties attempted by

enslaved Africans after being taken into the host community were extremely fragile due to the

normalization of family separation, refusal to recognize slave marriages, ability for whites to

enslave a free person of color with few legal repercussions, and empowerment of slave patrols to

hunt down runaways.<sup><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-link">131</a></sup> An enslaved parent was not legally recognized as having a right to their

child, but their enslaver was. This extreme unbelonging enabled the host community to objectify

and, ultimately, commodify enslaved people. The enslaved lived in a state of internal exile and

were often regarded as an “enemy within” by the subjugating classes.<sup><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-link">132</a></sup> We see this in natural

slavery theory, as Aristotle associates the slavish soul with the barbarian, who is non-Greek.<sup><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-link">133</a></sup>

But unlike with slavery in antiquity, the cultural differences between enslaved Blacks and free

whites hardened through the rise of scientific racism in the <sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-link">19</a></sup>th century, which presupposed that

people of African descent were of a biologically inferior order relative to people of European

descent.<sup><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-link">134</a></sup> Consequently, whiteness was a heavily guarded gate into the body politic—the United

States’ “one-drop rule” excluded mixed-race people from being recognized as white, and thus

having access to citizenship.

        Arendt has been able to recognize how racialization impedes one’s ability to culturally

assimilate into a community in which they are a minority. In “Reflections on Little Rock Nine”

(1958), Arendt underscores the enduring relationship between Blackness and foreignness in the

United States, as she likens the “visibility of the Negro” to the “audibility” of new immigrants to

discuss how descendants of enslaved Africans experienced social exclusion under Jim Crow:

        They are not the only “visible minority,” but they are the most visible one. In this respect,
        they somewhat resemble new immigrants who invariably constitute the most “audible” of
        all minorities and therefore are always the most likely to arouse xenophobic sentiments.
        But while audibility is a temporary phenomenon, rarely persisting beyond one generation,
        the Negroes' visibility is unalterable and permanent.<sup><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-link">135</a></sup>


The “unalterable and permanent” foreignness associated with Blackness was made salient by

chattel slavery, and served to uphold the system indefinitely. The alienation of Black people

parallels the othering of European refugees. This is evidenced by a representative to the League

of Nations openly characterizing the latter group as “inhabitants who would regard themselves as

permanently foreign” in their country of refuge.<sup><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-link">136</a></sup> Moreover, Arendt constructs a very similar

they were born.”<sup><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-link">137</a></sup> However, Arendt is incorrect to assert that “the impossibility of finding a new

one” was an unprecedented occurrence before the denaturalization process in Europe. In the

U.S., enslaved people were deprived of agency when it came to reestablishing a home within the

host community. Enslaved people were only allowed to operate as extensions of their

slaveholders, not as individuals with recognizable personhood. This extreme power differential

existing in a democratic polity can be best understood through what Patterson calls sovereignal

freedom, which he defines as “the degree that we exercise power, over ourselves and others.”<sup><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-link">138</a></sup>

This understanding of freedom, undergirded by ideas of mastery and conquest, defines the white

citizen’s dominion over the enslaved Black person.

        One may reasonably doubt that enslaved Africans were incapable of establishing a new

home for themselves in the New World. One might say that multiple routes to emancipation

made it so that enslaved Africans in the Americas could reclaim a distinct place in the world, in a

way that stateless Europeans generally could not.<sup><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-link">139</a></sup> To prove this difference, one could point to

the pervasiveness of concentration camps in the interwar period because, as Arendt argues, “if

the Nazis put a person in a concentration camp and if he made a successful escape, say, to

Holland, the Dutch would put him in an internment camp.”<sup><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-link">140</a></sup> In contrast, once a slaveholder

brings their enslaved laborers into free territory, they forfeit their claims to ownership under

common law practice. Additionally, the Republic of Haiti granted nationality to all

Africans—regardless of enslaved status—once they entered the country in its 1816 Constitution,

and the American Colonization Society attempted to repatriate thousands of people of African

modern-day Sierra Leone and Liberia.<sup><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-link">141</a></sup>

        However, these counter-arguments fail on three counts. Firstly, statelessness in the

interwar period was far more complex than one may assume, as some refugees—including

Arendt herself—were able to acquire residence in the U.S., the UK, and Israel. Secondly, one

cannot misconstrue the aforementioned facts as enslaved people having the right to travel to free

states or to Haiti. The aforementioned common law practice was still circumscribed by the

slaveholder’s choice to enter a free territory. The mobility of enslaved people was heavily

restricted by the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850, the latter of which being a legislative

response to the Underground Railroad. To exert agency, enslaved people had to flee and,

consequently, bear the label of “criminal” to attain freedom. Stateless Europeans were similarly

deprived of the right of residence. After World War I, Germany, Belgium, and other major

European powers canceled the naturalization applications of refugees en masse. These

cancellations denied refugees the chance to establish a new home.<sup><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-link">142</a></sup> Whether enslaved or

stateless, people were forced to look for a community where they could gain rights and were by

and large denied in their search. Thirdly, a deeper analysis of American Colonization Society’s

aims reveals how chattel slavery in the U.S. denied citizenship to all people of African descent,

not just those who were held in bondage. Repatriation efforts reveal how the most powerful

members of the American polity treated people of African descent as things to be rid of, much in

the same vein as how Arendt describes Europe’s treatment of refugees after World War II.<sup><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-link">143</a></sup>

           In the U.S., manumitting enslaved people did not lead to their political integration; to the

contrary, it created a new imperative for white society to make Black people deportable. White

slaveholding statesmen such as Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson financially supported efforts to

deny Black people the right of residence years before the Dred Scott decision, and they did so

while asserting their own benevolence. Proponents of the repatriation argued that free Black

people would fare better in Africa than in the U.S.<sup><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-link">144</a></sup> In truth, the white slaveholding class feared

the political agency of the free Black population. Abolitionists and free-born Black people,

especially those who lived in the U.S. for multiple generations, resisted emigration because the

scheme viewed African-American citizenship as unthinkable.<sup><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-link">145</a></sup> The logic of repatriation was

ultimately one of expulsion. It presumed the foreignness of the Black person in America,

irrespective of their free status or generational attachment to the U.S., and the threat that free

Black people posed to the maintenance of a white supremacist plantocracy. Through

manumission, freedpeople could no longer be used exclusively as a tool for capital accumulation

by white planter elites—the truest citizens of the United States. Freed from acute economic

deprivation, the formerly enslaved could take political action; the lives of Frederick Douglass

and Harriet Tubman exemplified this. Separately, free-born Black people disrupted the vision of

the U.S. as a racially homogeneous nation-state, a vision that the American government was

attempting to realize through westward expansion under the ideology of manifest destiny. In

many ways, this campaign to excise the free Black population explains the political imperative

behind the ruling in Dred Scott, as the two are rooted in the same fear—the fear of Black

political empowerment.

Dred Scott and the Loss of the Polity

        In a 7-2 ruling, Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) crystallized the natal alienation of

African-Americans in a juridical context. The Supreme Court marked “the loss of the polity

itself” for anyone socially recognized as Black; such a loss constitutes statelessness from

Arendt’s perspective.<sup><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-link">146</a></sup> The facts of the case bear this out: Between 1836 and 1846, Dred Scott

and Harriet Robinson, an enslaved couple, lived in free land —the state of Illinois and territory

of Wisconsin—due to moving around with Scott’s slaveholder, Dr. John Emerson. When

Emerson died in 1843, his widow Eliza Irene Sanford inherited his estate, including his chattel.

Sanford refused to manumit Scott, Robinson, and their daughters, despite them offering payment.

After a series of trials in Missouri state courts, the enslaved couple sued in federal court in 1853

and the central legal questions were the following: Had the Scott family been permanently

manumitted once they entered a free territory? Did they have standing to sue under the 5th

Amendment? The Supreme Court not only ruled that the Scotts were still enslaved, but that no

individual of African descent could sue in federal court because they did not have citizenship.

        This ruling was a process of denationalization, not just a confirmation of it, because the

Court said that Congress did not have the right to prohibit slavery in new territories, rendering

legislation such as the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. The Scotts felt entitled to freedom

due to their residence in Wisconsin Territory, which had been admitted as a free territory by the

Northwest Ordinance of 1787—an act of Congress.<sup><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-link">147</a></sup> By denying the Scotts freedom, the

Supreme Court opened the door for Black freedpeople in previously unorganized territories to be

reenslaved, should their ex-masters sue to reclaim them. And while states could confer freedoms

  Taney, Dred Scott v. Sandford, <sup><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-link">60</a></sup> U.S. <sup><a href="#fn394" class="footnote-link">394</a></sup>. By the time of Taney’s opinion, the Missouri Compromise had been
overridden by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed residents of new territories to decide whether to allow or
ban slavery.

                                                      <sup><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-link">69</a></sup>

to a Black person that were commensurate with those of whites, those freedoms would “not

make him a citizen of the United States, nor entitle him to sue in its courts, nor to any of the

privileges and immunities of a citizen in another State.”<sup><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-link">148</a></sup> By excluding Black people from the

purview of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Supreme Court made their free status

revocable once they entered a slaveholding state. No constitutional guarantee of due process at

the state level existed at that point. As a result, no right was inalienable for the enslaved or their

descendants. Chief Justice Roger Taney confirmed that the privileges granted to those racialized

as Black were entirely subject to the polity’s will.

         Moreover, the Dred Scott decision epitomizes the contradiction between the universalist

ideals espoused by American revolutionaries and the exclusionary praxis of the racial contract.<sup><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-link">149</a></sup>

By declaring “[e]very citizen has a right to take with him into the Territory any article of

property which the Constitution of the United States recognises as property,”<sup><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-link">150</a></sup> the Supreme

Court chose to ignore a common law doctrine that benefitted formerly enslaved defendants. To

justify this, Justice Taney applies originalism when interpreting the Fugitive Slave Clause and

Three-Fifths Compromise: “The only two clauses in the Constitution which point to this race,

treat them as persons whom it was morally lawful to deal in as articles of property and to hold as

slaves.”<sup><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-link">151</a></sup> The only means to reverse this decision was through the passage of the <sup><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-link">13</a></sup>th and <sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-link">14</a></sup>th

Amendments. Until then, avenues for manumission, freedom of movement, marriage, and other

privileges were circumscribed by slave codes and the whims of individual slaveholders, neither

of which were obligated to consider enslaved people’s opinions, much less their humanity.<sup><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-link">152</a></sup> By

re-enslaving the Scott family, the Supreme Court also denied sovereignal freedom to Scott and

Harriet, as they no longer had a right to their own daughters—Eliza Sanford and her brother did.

This exposed the Scotts to the danger of being separated, as the Sanfords would have been within

their rights to sell each of them. The possibility of severing the family unit—the ultimate kinship

tie—typifies the Supreme Court's endorsement of natal alienation for Afro-descended people.

        Justice Taney’s conception of whiteness as a prerequisite of American citizenship

descends from normative understandings of the nation-state. White slaveholding framers such as

George Washington and Thomas Jefferson constituted the original “people of the United States”

and it is only through shared heritage with those men that one can claim citizenship. Rather than

literal genealogy, this shared heritage is the image of community over time, as political theorist

Bernard Yack puts it.<sup><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-link">153</a></sup> White immigrants had access to the polity; Black people born in the U.S.

did not, even if they were mixed with European ancestry. To resolve this contradiction, Justice

Taney again looked to the framers’ original intent, finding that Black people “were not regarded

in any of the States as members of the community which constituted the State” when the

Constitution was adopted.<sup><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-link">154</a></sup> As the Dred Scott decision illustrates, enslaved individuals were

wholly excluded from citizenship under popular sovereignty because the Constitution, and thus

all national political institutions, recognized them as “foreign” and outside the polity’s bounds.

The white supremacist manifestation of popular sovereignty in Dred Scott predates by sixty years

Europe’s Minority Treaties—treaties which Arendt reads as remarkable for making plain the

exclusionary underpinnings of citizenship within the nation-state: “[O]nly nationals could be

citizens, only people of the same national origin could enjoy the full protection of legal

institutions.”<sup><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-link">155</a></sup> By not deeply engaging with American chattel slavery in her analysis, Arendt

misses Dred Scott as a process of denationalization. This omission is critical because the

Supreme Court rendered people of African descent illegible under national law.



Slavery, Statelessness, and Legal Recognition

            The continuity between statelessness and the condition of enslaved Black people is that

both render the individual’s rights to enter and to leave a territory into which they were born

asymmetrical in a way that citizens do not experience. By exploring international and

subnational mobility, one uncovers some discontinuities between chattel slavery and Arendtian

statelessness. Stateless Europeans and enslaved Africans differed in their ability to exercise the

right of entry and the right of exit. For the stateless, the right of exit varied significantly based on

the policies of their “home” country. Some enjoyed greater freedom of movement than jailed

criminals, while others were herded into displaced persons camps.<sup><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-link">156</a></sup> Due to being a means of

capital accumulation, enslaved people—unlike most residents of a territory—did not have the

right to leave. In the American context, enslaved Black people were economically productive as

extensions of the plantations and households they supported. They could generate value for their

slaveholder if they left the plantation while being leased to another white person. However, they

could not generate value if they left to a free territory. In Arendt’s conception of statelessness,

losing the right of entry and the right of exit is emblematic of rightless people becoming illegible

in the eyes of the law. Whether enslaved people can be considered illegible strikes at the heart of

Arendt’s comparison between statelessness and slavery.

            To understand why Arendt felt compelled to compare those held in bondage to those she

considered stateless, we must look at the issue of legal recognition for both parties. According to

Arendt, what distinguishes statelessness from enslavement is the fact that the former, in contrast
<sup><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-link">156</a></sup>
      Ibid., <sup><a href="#fn296" class="footnote-link">296</a></sup>.

                                                   <sup><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-link">72</a></sup>

to the latter, deprived people “of all clearly established, officially recognized identity.”<sup><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-link">157</a></sup>

Stateless people do not exist in regards to the law in the country they reside in. At most, they are

recognized as “displaced persons” under international law.<sup><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-link">158</a></sup> The extent to which the term can be

regarded as true legal recognition is dubious, as international law—constituted by parties in a

treaty acting in good faith—is not enforceable in the way domestic law is within a sovereign

state. Moreover, the term “displaced persons” erases the legal void in which stateless people are

stranded because it assumes that the stateless can simply be relocated to their “country of origin,”

even when that country will not recognize the stateless person as a citizen.

         In contrast, those who agree with Arendt may argue that the evasive diction of the U.S.

Constitution, where enslaved people are referred to as “all other Persons” with regard to the

Three-Fifths Compromise, and the very existence of slave codes acknowledged the personhood

of enslaved Black people in distinct ways. The former acknowledges the personhood of the

enslaved rhetorically. The latter keeps enslaved people within the pale of humanity when one

considers an argument Frederick Douglass made in “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?”

(1852): If the slaveholding class truly believed enslaved Africans were subhuman, then they

would not need to regulate them so differently from other animal-property. For example, do

states ban cattle from learning to read and write? Do they criminally punish dogs for running

away from home? In both cases, no. But Virginia and other slaveholding states did precisely that

to enslaved Blacks in order to prevent them from attaining equal status as whites.<sup><a href="#fn159" class="footnote-link">159</a></sup> In both the

Constitution and slave codes, enslaved people were legible when compared to the stateless

Europeans. Even the enslaved person could be legally recognized as having existed by the state

in which they reside.

        However, state laws that banned literacy among enslaved populations actively remove the

rights to opinion and to action, the loss of which Arendt finds fundamental to the condition of

rightlessness.<sup><a href="#fn160" class="footnote-link">160</a></sup> Furthermore, by declaring that people of African descent could not sue in federal

court and were not “persons” under the 5th Amendment, the Dred Scott decision excluded all

Black people, including the manumitted and the free-born, from due process, the essence of

rights-bearing.<sup><a href="#fn161" class="footnote-link">161</a></sup> This exclusion occurred despite the rhetorical contortions that the founding

fathers made in order to avoid naming chattel slavery directly in the Constitution. We must ask:

What good does legibility produce for the individual if said legibility does not enable the

exercise of rights or protection under the law? The extent to which enslaved Africans were

within the pale of the law prior to Dred Scott was severely limited, as they could not testify in

court against a white person nor serve on juries. But they were removed from the pale entirely if

they ever chose to run away. As mentioned in the third section, the only way for an enslaved

person to contest their subjugation was through illegal means.

        Fugitive slaves provide an interesting case study with regard to Arendt’s comparison

between the stateless and the lawfully imprisoned criminal. Arendt claims that a stateless person

could improve their situation by committing a crime because, once they do, the stateless person

enters the purview of the law and “will not be treated any worse than another criminal.”<sup><a href="#fn162" class="footnote-link">162</a></sup> In this

assessment, Arendt neglects to consider the social identities and forces which make differences

between citizens and rightless people salient. In the case of American slavery, those forces were

economic exploitation and white supremacy. On the one hand, criminality, specifically running

away, could improve the condition of the enslaved person—but only if it resulted in the enslaved

person gaining their emancipation and not getting caught. Otherwise, criminality could easily

worsen the enslaved person’s condition because they would be wholly subject to their

slaveholder’s wrath without any protection from the law. Escaped slaves carried the labels of

“stolen property” and “wanted criminal,” on top of being racialized as a foreigner. These labels

denied protection for the slave’s personhood, and the mark of criminality certainly would not

yield access to counsel or the right to a jury. An enslaved person’s position is incomparable to

that of a white criminal, regardless of whether the arrest of either is lawful. To successfully

transgress the law, fugitive slaves relied upon their proximity to free states to gain freedom. Even

then, aforementioned fugitive slave acts impeded success. Engaging in criminality can hardly be

seen as a choice for enslaved people, when that “choice” was made under the pain of death.



Conclusion

           Through the letter of the law and extreme economic deprivation, the white slaveholding

class rendered Africans rightless and racialized them as “Black” in order to curb any attempts

they made to enter the American polity. Patterson’s natal alienation allows us to understand the

statelessness that afflicted enslaved Africans generationally. The enslaved African’s statuses as

property, worker, and foreigner created a trifecta wherein they could never be recognized as

human by the political community enslaving them. This extreme unbelonging did not end upon

manumission. The American Colonization Society’s project and similar proposals made during

the 1850s to expel free Afro-descended people to the West Indies make Arendt’s claim that

imperialism was “the one great crime in which America was never involved” woefully

ahistorical.<sup><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-link">163</a></sup> The expulsion campaign proved that the socioeconomic subjugation of the

enslaved was mutually constitutive with the political domination of the citizen, who, after the

Dred Scott ruling, was unambiguously the free-born white man. In that ruling, the Supreme

Court confirmed the longstanding belief that Black citizenship was incompatible with the future

of the United States as a white nation-state. This belief persisted in the white American

consciousness well after the Civil War. Due to the failure of Reconstruction, the condition of

statelessness for African-Americans did not end with formal abolition. Arendt should have

known this because she was living in Jim Crow America while writing Origins. Her

unwillingness to consider enslaved people of African descent as stateless leads her to miss the de

facto statelessness that was occurring right under her nose.
