        <p>The Supreme Court based its ruling against granting copyright privileges to AI-authored works on a narrow construction of the word "individual," in <em>Thaler v. Vidal</em>. This article explores the consequences of this decision in terms of the (1) moral imperatives that might guide interaction with AI, (2) separation of powers between judicial and executive branches of government, and (3) the relationship between human and machine producers in a competitive market. The final analysis reveals that <em>Thaler</em> is likely to carry increasing legal authority moving forward, despite the fact that it is not necessarily beneficial to keep AI out of the market.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The emergence of advanced artificial intelligence, capable of producing creative and original works, created an intellectual property problem: could these works be granted privileges in American copyright law? There was no law that stated they could not, but the laws that govern intellectual property were not written with AI in mind. According to the Chevron doctrine—which says that "courts should defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute"<sup><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-link">82</a></sup> – entities like the U.S. Copyright Office have significant discretionary power in deciding whether or not existing law allows AI-authored works to get IP protections. In 2024, the Supreme Court is expected, by many, to discard the Chevron doctrine,<sup><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-link">83</a></sup> creating a legal environment in which judges will determine what to do with AI-produced works and IP, with less guidance from the executive branch. This change creates an expectation that the 2022 decision in <em>Thaler v Vidal</em>, which assigned a narrow construction to the word "individual," will become a more important source of legal authority, moving forward.</p>

        <p><em>Thaler</em> established that AI programs cannot hold copyrights, on the grounds that an AI program is not an "individual." With the court's holding poised to become more authoritative in banning AI-authored works from the market, two important issues emerge: (1) the narrow construction of the word "individual" in <em>Thaler</em> is somewhat arbitrary, and (2) it is not necessarily beneficial to keep AI-authored works out of the marketplace.</p>

        <p>Stephen Thaler applied for a patent on behalf of an AI program, acknowledging that the "invention [was] generated by artificial intelligence."<sup><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-link">84</a></sup> His application was denied before failing on appeal. The appellate court ruled that only an object of human production is protected under the Patent Act.<sup><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-link">85</a></sup> This holding did not totally resolve the question because it did not determine where the line between human-augmented and totally-automated are delineated. If AI programs alone cannot receive legal privileges for their creations, how would the law apply to cases of joint authorship between humans and AI?</p>

        <p>In 2022, Kristina Kashtanova published a graphic novel with AI-generated illustrations. After initially granting a copyright for the work, the USCO canceled her registration. A month after canceling the registration, the USCO announced that it would – all of a sudden – allow AI-authorship.<sup><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-link">86</a></sup> Not only did the development contradict the cancellation of Kashtanova's earlier copyright, it also seemed close to contradicting <em>Thaler</em>. Although, it is important to note that a human-AI co-authored work does have a human author, and is thus within <em>Thaler</em>'s narrow construction of "individual." While the USCO's initial decision about the Kashtanova copyright appeared to exclude AI authors, its subsequent rule change suggested the prospect of more inclusive policies. The USCO presented contradictory leanings with regard to the underlying legal ambiguity, despite <em>Thaler</em> and despite the logic that the Chevron doctrine depends on. Why then, one might ask, is this such a difficult question for legal authorities?</p>

        <h3>Background: The Utilitarian Gray Area</h3>

        <p>Despite <em>Thaler</em>, the law is ambiguous over the question of granting copyrights and other intellectual property privileges to AI. There are two flavors of approaches to the issue, one is judicial and the other is political. The judicial answer is that some laws have narrow wording, such as "individual," that could be argued to preclude AI. The <em>Thaler</em> decision depends on this reasoning.<sup><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-link">87</a></sup> If <em>Thaler</em> categorically bans granting IP protections to AI-authored works, that is a judicial solution to this question. The political approach is acknowledging that there is a danger to human competitors in the market if non-human alternatives are able to produce comparable work and receive the same legal privileges. Of the two classes of approaches, the judicial approach is the useful one, if for no other reason than the recalcitrant nature of the political process.</p>

        <p>The issue with <em>Thaler</em> is that the narrow construction of "individual" is somewhat arbitrary. Both narrow and broad constructions for words like "individual" and "person" have been applied to different laws, and there is not a clear a priori reason that a narrow or broad construction is better than the other. For example, the construction of "person" used in the Equal Rights Amendment includes companies.<sup><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-link">88</a></sup> But the Torture Victims Protection Act only understands "individual" as a human being.<sup><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-link">89</a></sup> One could say that "individual" and "person" are sufficiently disanalogous for this to be a non-issue, but they are essentially synonyms and laws are generally understood to be based on the meaning of words within the language at the time of writing. Arguing that there exists some special reason that the word "person" has a broader meaning than "individual" is somewhat suspect.</p>

        <p>Like the judicial solution, the political solution also depends on relatively uncertain logic. If AI-authorship could be proven to be bad for human artists, congress could simply ban such works. One could say that the political solution might rely on the assumption that congress needs to change the law because existing law is incoherent. Legal scholar Margot Kaminski points out that a foundational "purpose of copyright law…[is] to incentivize (presumably human) authors to create new works for the benefit of net social welfare."<sup><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-link">90</a></sup> If allowing AI into the creative market disincentivizes all human competitors, a situation emerges where a law that exists to incentivize actually disincentivizes. Self-contradictory laws can be said to need amendment so as to not self-contradict. The problem with a political solution, however, is that it depends on the assumption that congress legislates according to efficiency and collective benefit, rather than politics.</p>

        <p>Both <em>Thaler</em> and Kashtanova failed to gain IP protections, which suggests that authorities lean toward excluding AI-authored works. Without a mandate from congress forcing them to ban these works, and with the Chevron doctrine's uncertain future, the <em>Thaler</em> decision has become an important source of legal authority. Before discussing the reasoning behind this important decision, however, it is important to consider the relationship between humans and AI in the competitive market.</p>

        <h3>Fear the Machines: A Psychological Framework</h3>

        <p>The fear of AI replacing human workers is not new, but it has taken on new urgency with the development of sophisticated AI systems capable of producing creative works. This fear is often framed in terms of economic competition and job displacement, but it also has deeper psychological and philosophical dimensions.</p>

        <p>From a psychological perspective, the fear of AI authorship can be understood as a form of existential anxiety. Human creativity has long been considered one of the defining characteristics of human uniqueness and value. The idea that machines could produce creative works that are indistinguishable from human creations threatens this sense of uniqueness and raises questions about what it means to be human.</p>

        <p>This psychological framework helps explain why the legal treatment of AI-authored works has been so contentious. The question is not simply whether AI systems can produce works that meet the technical requirements for copyright protection, but whether granting such protection would undermine fundamental assumptions about human creativity and value.</p>

        <p>The <em>Thaler</em> decision can be seen as a response to this psychological framework. By narrowly construing the term "individual" to exclude AI systems, the court reaffirmed the traditional understanding that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic. This decision provides legal support for the psychological need to maintain human uniqueness in the face of technological advancement.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>The <em>Thaler v. Vidal</em> decision represents a significant milestone in the legal treatment of AI-generated content. By narrowly construing the term "individual" to exclude AI systems, the court established an important precedent that is likely to become more authoritative as the Chevron doctrine faces potential elimination.</p>

        <p>However, the decision also raises important questions about the arbitrary nature of legal interpretation and the potential benefits of allowing AI-authored works into the marketplace. The narrow construction of "individual" in <em>Thaler</em> is not necessarily justified by clear legal principles, and the exclusion of AI-authored works may not serve the broader goals of copyright law.</p>

        <p>As AI technology continues to evolve, the legal framework will need to adapt to address these challenges. The <em>Thaler</em> decision provides a foundation for this adaptation, but it also highlights the need for more nuanced approaches to the question of AI authorship and intellectual property rights.</p>
