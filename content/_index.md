The Amherst College Law Review (ACLR) was born out of the desire to foster undergraduate scholarship in the liberal arts. Among our peers, the ACLR stands alone for its interdisciplinary approach to the study of law.

Given the ever-changing nature of our society, students of law encounter a host of new, troubling, and intriguing questions including, but not limited to, increasing inequality, salience of technology, and neoliberal globalization. These questions cannot be fully posed, much less answered, within the scope of conventional legal training and/or the traditional social sciences.

The mission of the ACLR is to pose these questions and to strive to answer them with the nuance, clarity, probity, and rigor provided by the liberal arts tradition. This journal brings the best scholarship of the contemporary humanities to bear on the most difficult and urgent juridical problems of our time.
