        <p>As stated by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, it is not permissible that “private property be taken for public use, without just compensation”.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-link">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-link">2</a></sup> The Fourteenth Amendment extends these rights from the federal government to the states, establishing that it is likewise impermissible for “any State to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Takings Clause specifies that one whose property is taken by the government for public use is entitled to just compensation, but it fails to specify further details regarding its implementation or capacities. Chief among concerns of policymakers and property owners alike, the Takings Clause fails to specify how to determine whether an imposition by the government on one’s private property might constitute a compensable taking.</p>
        <p>
        In <em>Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York</em> and <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</em>, arguments for the unconstitutionality of policies restricting development by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were made. In each case, it was found that no taking was committed by the government in imposing these restrictions. These cases feature the creation and implementation of policy evaluation criteria, which would be situationally applied to find that legitimate public interest to preserve a distinct aesthetic outweighed the utility of economic development in cases deemed worthy by legislation. </p>
<br>
  <h3><em>Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York</em></h3>
<br>
<p>In 1978, the Court of Appeals of New York ruled on a case in which the Penn Central Transportation Company appealed a decision by New York City to restrict development atop a site which had been designated a “landmark”. This case, Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York, challenged whether the city’s restrictions on development atop Penn Central’s property, Grand Central Terminal, constituted a compensable taking as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
</p>
<p>
The Grand Central Terminal was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Committee on August 2, 1967. This action followed the adoption of the Landmarks Preservation Law in 1965, also known as the “Landmarks Law,” which sought to foster “civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past” through the protection of important cultural and historical landmarks in the city. This law would require that the owner of a landmark keep the building’s exterior in “good repair,” and alterations to their exterior must be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The law’s creation and adoption were based upon widespread agreement among the city’s residents and leaders that implementing such a program would yield greater economic benefits to New York than the development it would restrict. A 1968 ordinance gave owners of landmark sites opportunities for transferring development rights to nearby parcels, thus mitigating damages to property owners caused by the Landmarks Law.
</p>
<p>
In January 1968, Penn Central entered into a 50-year lease with UGP Properties, Inc. Under the terms of the lease, UGP was to construct a large office building above the Grand Central Terminal. UGP was to pay a substantial lease fee to Penn Central annually during and after construction of the building. Two building plans, one being a 55-story office building to be built atop the terminal and another 53-story building which required significant alterations to the building’s facades for construction atop the terminal, were submitted to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. In September 1968, the Commission denied a certificate of no exterior effect. Appellants applied for certificates of appropriateness for the two proposed plans, which resulted in four days of hearings with over 80 witnesses; these applications were also denied.
