        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>As stated by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, it is impermissible that “private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” The Fourteenth Amendment extends these rights from the federal government to the states, establishing that it is likewise impermissible for “any State to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Takings Clause specifies that one whose property is taken by the government for public use is entitled to just compensation, but it fails to specify further details regarding its implementation. Chief among concerns of policymakers and property owners alike, the Takings Clause fails to specify how to determine whether an imposition by the government on one’s private property might constitute a compensable taking.</p>

        <p>In Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York and Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, arguments for the unconstitutionality of policies restricting development by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were made. These cases feature the creation and implementation of policy evaluation criteria which would be situationally applied to find that legitimate public interest to preserve a distinct aesthetic outweighed the utility of economic development in cases deemed worthy by legislation.</p>
