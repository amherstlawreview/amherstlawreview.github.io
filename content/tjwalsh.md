        <p>As stated by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, it is not permissible that “private property be taken for public use, without just compensation”.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-link">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-link">2</a></sup> The Fourteenth Amendment extends these rights from the federal government to the states, establishing that it is likewise impermissible for “any State to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Takings Clause specifies that one whose property is taken by the government for public use is entitled to just compensation, but it fails to specify further details regarding its implementation or capacities. Chief among concerns of policymakers and property owners alike, the Takings Clause fails to specify how to determine whether an imposition by the government on one’s private property might constitute a compensable taking.</p>
        <p>
        In <em>Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York</em> and <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</em>, arguments for the unconstitutionality of policies restricting development by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were made. In each case, it was found that no taking was committed by the government in imposing these restrictions. These cases feature the creation and implementation of policy evaluation criteria, which would be situationally applied to find that legitimate public interest to preserve a distinct aesthetic outweighed the utility of economic development in cases deemed worthy by legislation. </p>

  <h3><em>Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York</em></h3>

<p>In 1978, the Court of Appeals of New York ruled on a case in which the Penn Central Transportation Company appealed a decision by New York City to restrict development atop a site which had been designated a “landmark”. This case, Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York, challenged whether the city’s restrictions on development atop Penn Central’s property, Grand Central Terminal, constituted a compensable taking as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
</p>
<p>
The Grand Central Terminal was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Committee on August 2, 1967. This action followed the adoption of the Landmarks Preservation Law in 1965, also known as the “Landmarks Law,” which sought to foster “civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past” through the protection of important cultural and historical landmarks in the city. This law would require that the owner of a landmark keep the building’s exterior in “good repair,” and alterations to their exterior must be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The law’s creation and adoption were based upon widespread agreement among the city’s residents and leaders that implementing such a program would yield greater economic benefits to New York than the development it would restrict. A 1968 ordinance gave owners of landmark sites opportunities for transferring development rights to nearby parcels, thus mitigating damages to property owners caused by the Landmarks Law.
</p>
<p>
In January 1968, Penn Central entered into a 50-year lease with UGP Properties, Inc. Under the terms of the lease, UGP was to construct a large office building above the Grand Central Terminal. UGP was to pay a substantial lease fee to Penn Central annually during and after construction of the building. Two building plans, one being a 55-story office building to be built atop the terminal and another 53-story building which required significant alterations to the building’s facades for construction atop the terminal, were submitted to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. In September 1968, the Commission denied a certificate of no exterior effect. Appellants applied for certificates of appropriateness for the two proposed plans, which resulted in four days of hearings with over 80 witnesses; these applications were also denied.
</p>
<p>
Penn Central did not pursue a judicial review of these denied certificate applications, nor did they attempt to develop an alternative to the proposed building plans which might be deemed more suitable an alteration to the Grand Central Terminal. Instead, they filed suit in the New York Supreme Court. The appellants asserted that the city had taken their property with neither just compensation nor due process, thus violating rights guaranteed to them by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
</p>
<p>
In considering the appellants’ assertion that they had been denied due process, the Court considered several conditions. Due process would not be violated if use of property as it had been before the government’s imposition was still permitted; the appellants had failed to prove that they were unable to earn a reasonable return on their investment in a property as-is; if the property in question was unable to make a reasonable return on investment, the appellants’ profits from nearby holdings could be partially attributed to a property; and the transferrable nature of lost development rights above a property provided just compensation for the appellants’ loss of said development rights. After an ad hoc evaluation of each condition, the Court ruled that Penn Central was not denied due process as prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The lack of interference with existing business operations and viability of continued return on real estate investment led them to conclude that due process had not been violated. The Court also makes a pertinent assertion that Penn Central was provided viable alternatives for earning the financial returns projected from their proposed development at the Grand Central Terminal, such as creating a different design to build atop the terminal or appealing the commission’s decision, but they did not pursue these alternatives.
</p>
<p>
In considering the appellants’ assertion that the city had committed a compensable taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment, the Court considered several other conditions. First, not all government actions that restrict economic values constitute a taking. As such, an understanding of the circumstances around an alleged taking is required to determine whether a compensable taking has occurred. Diminution in property value resulting from zoning laws cannot, on its own, establish a taking. A zoning law which exclusively restricts modification of existing property features does not restrict airspace above the property, nor does it restrict gainful development of other portions of the property. If a zoning law which does not interfere with continued operation or revenue gains from a property and allows for development rights to be transferred to other properties, then such a law reasonably mitigates financial burdens imposed upon a property owner by said zoning law. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that the city’s application of its Landmarks Law did not constitute a compensable taking. As such, the Court held that the application of the Landmarks Law to the Penn Central Transportation Company’s Grand Central Terminal did not constitute an unjust taking of the company’s property as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.
</p>
<p>
This ruling established the precedent that laws restricting the alteration of existing property do not, on their own, constitute a compensable taking of property. If continued operation and monetary return on investment following development restrictions on a property are unaffected by said restrictions, it is permissible for a government to impose these restrictions without compensation afforded to property owners. Two years after this ruling, in 1980, the state of New York passed its State Historic Preservation Act and established the State Register of Historic Places.
</p>
<p>
<em>Penn Central v. City of New York</em> set forth a procedure which established a precedent for ad hoc policy evaluation, demonstrating that unique circumstances around a policy’s enactment ought to be evaluated in comparable cases. <em>Seawall Associates v. City of New York</em> used a similar approach to Penn Central to determine that the city had gone beyond its legal limits to restrict development of single-room occupancy properties. <em>Society for Ethical Culture v. Spatt</em> applied the <em>Penn Central v. City of New York</em> method to determine that a religious building’s designation under the Landmarks Law was valid so long as the free exercise of religion was not impeded, thus reversing a previous ruling.
